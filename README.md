# Neural Network architecture from scratch

## About
This project contains a list of Jupyter Notebooks where I try to implement several common Neural Network architecture from scratch (using only numpy)

## Architectures

- Deep Neural Network: I illustrate how to create and training a neural network from scratch (using only numpy) to classify labels in a 2D spiral dataset
- Recurrent Neural Network (RNN): I demonstrate how to implement a traditional RNN to perform the task of sentiment analysis
- Gated Recurrent Unit (RNN): I implement and use GRU layer to perform the same task of sentiment analysis
- Long Short Term Memory (LSTM): I demonstrate how another RNN architecture can help solve the task of sentiment analysis
